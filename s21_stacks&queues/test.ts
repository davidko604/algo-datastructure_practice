        "Meet James Nord, the founder of the influencer marketing platform @Fohr. 👋We asked him to share his insights and data on how COVID-19 is affecting the influencer marketing industry, and most importantly, how to build a *strategy* while the future of the industry is rapidly changing.⚡⁠\n⁠\nThere's no doubt that COVID-19 has made a strong impact on influencer marketing: campaigns are being paused and influencers are reducing rates. But on the flip side, engagement on sponsored content is increasing as Instagram usage has increased by over 40%. 💸 ⁠\n⁠\nWith all of these changes, there's still one thing we know for sure: With screen time increasing, so is the standard of content. 👈Striking the correct tone in your visuals and captions is now absolutely vital. From showcasing sensitivity to surroundings (like relatable WFH struggles) to providing value that builds community and connection - approach and authenticity matters more than ever. ⁠\n⁠\nHead over to the blog to find loads of data (and examples of creators doing this right) to understand how the influencer marketing industry is pivoting to a new normal. 👀⁠\n⁠\n⁠⤴ Link in bio: The Impact of COVID-19 on Influencer Marketing ⤴⁣ ⁠ ",

        "While we don't have *all* the answers for marketing your business through this challenging time, we can give you some guiding principles to help you think through your posts and make decisions as the situation evolves. 💡Here's a couple ways to think about pivoting your content:⁠\n⁠\n 💬Listen & acknowledge. Things aren't normal, and operating as though they are, runs the risk of coming across tone-deaf to an audience with heightened sensitivities & anxieties. Let your followers see your human side and know that you truly care. ⁠\n⁠\n🔑 Keep posting. Your followers are spending more time online than ever before, and we all want to stay connected. If you're unable to market or sell your products or services right now, focus on sharing content that aligns with your brand values instead.⁠\n⁠\n✨ Provide organic value. Turn your Instagram into a valuable resource for your audience by giving extra education and resources right in your captions. ⁠\n⁠\n💕 Lean on your community. Get vulnerable in your content, share your story, and clearly communicate how your followers can support your business right now. Or if you're in the position to give back, get creative in highlighting that. ⁠\n⁠\nThe main thing to remember is that this is brand new territory for us all, so while there's no perfect playbook for navigating content in the age of Covid-19, this is a good place to start.⁠\n⁠\nHead to our blog for more tips on what kind of content you could be posting, and a ton of examples of brands getting it right, plus a few ideas for projects to work on. ⁠🌈⁠\n⁠\n⁠⤴ Link in bio: Social Media & Covid-19: How to Communicate During a Crisis ⤴⁣ ⁣⁠\n⁠\n 📷: @tinycactus",
